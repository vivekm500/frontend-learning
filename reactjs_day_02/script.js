/*
React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, mainly single-page applications (SPAs) where the UI changes dynamically without reloading the page.

Important correction upfront:

React is NOT a framework

It does ONE job well: rendering and managing UI efficiently

It was created by Facebook (Meta) and is now one of the most used UI libraries in the world.
